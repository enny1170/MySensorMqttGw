# MySensorMqttGw
Extended MySensor Mqtt Gatway based on ESP12

This Projcet is a try to build a extended MQTT-Gateway for MySensors network.

The existing examples only configrable by #defines in the sketch. And we will try to make this configurable by a embedded Web-Page

Also you got a Problem by using MQTT for communication to your automation Controller. It is not possible to get Node-Id's for your connected Sensors from Controller. This will try to do this in the Gateway. 

This project uses the platformio Framework.
